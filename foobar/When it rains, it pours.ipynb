      "\n",
      "It's raining, it's pouring. You and your agents are nearing the building where the captive rabbits are being held, but a sudden storm puts your escape plans at risk. The structural integrity of the rabbit hutches you've built to house the fugitive rabbits is at risk because they can buckle when wet. Before the rabbits can be rescued from Professor Boolean's lab, you must compute how much standing water has accumulated on the rabbit hutches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, suppose there is a line of hutches, stacked to various heights and water is poured from the top (and allowed to run off the sides). We'll assume all the hutches are square, have side length 1, and for the purposes of this problem we'll pretend that the hutch arrangement is two-dimensional.\n",
