## OSCON Notes
* Check out DreamFactory's REST API generation - what's their take on it
* CartoDB - recommend to K & C.
    * Check out their MapAcademy for tutorials.
    * `torque.js` is DB-independent. Todo: figure out what `torque.js` does, exactly.
* `card.io` - very cool, check out the video fo' sho'.
    * Dude had no previous knowledge of computer vision, basically just got started
    and felt his way through.
    * R&D'd in Python, then ported over to C++, which was compatible with
      Obj-C, and had JNI-bindings (terribly painful) in Android.
