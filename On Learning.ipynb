    "* Using features of the information to classifying & divide concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Begin with the problem space. Overview of \"Why are we learning this? What are the fundamental problems this is trying to address?\"\n",
    "    * Why do we use databases? We need ways to manage incredibly large sets of data and its metadata. Metadata can include the relationships within data.\n",
    "    * What problems do databases have to solve? Writing to disk is very slow compared to the rest of I/O, so all databases need to optimize this. How they do so is a significant difference between databases.\n",
    "        * We can use this difference as a means of classifying and comparing different databases.\n",
    "        \n",
    "* Provide a framework for comparison\n",
    "    * Would listing up-front the variables for comparison overwhelm or assist? Perhaps this is size-dependent on the number of variables.\n",
    "* Use a common example across the different categories\n",
    "    * For databases, have a given set of data, and depict how it's stored in different DBs.\n",
    "    * In military terms, this would be the \"walk\" phase - hand-holding still involved. The \"run\" might be creating a data set, and having the student depict the different style of storage.\n"
