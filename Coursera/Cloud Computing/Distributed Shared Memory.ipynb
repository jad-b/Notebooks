    "# Distributed Shared Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually assume processes pass messages via the network.\n",
    "If we could store messages in a shared memory location, we could be better people.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a multi-processor system could use its physically shared memory as a common buffer, distributed systems will instead have to have a common *remote* buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Invalidate Approach\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "* Each process maintains a cache, which stores pages recently accessed by that process.\n",
    "* Memory pages are mapped in local memory, as well as the cache\n",
    "* R/W first hits the cache\n",
    "    * If present: page *hit*\n",
    "    * If missing: page *fault* (kernel trap)\n",
    "        * Invoke DSM software to retrieve page from another process on network. Probably use multicast, everyone else does.\n",
    "* Owner = process with latest version of page\n",
    "* Page is either in R or W state\n",
    "* When in R,\n",
    "    * Owner has a R copy in its local cache\n",
    "    * Other processes may also have R copies\n",
    "    * No W copies exist\n",
    "* When in W state,\n",
    "    * Only owner has a copy (exclusive)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Scenarios\n",
    "#### Reading\n",
    "* You can use your cached copy if\n",
    "    * P1 is owner of page in R state\n",
    "        * Read from cache\n",
    "    * P1 is owner of page in W state\n",
    "        * Read from cache\n",
    "    * P1 is owner of page in R state. Other processes also have page in R state\n",
    "        * Read from cache\n",
    "    * P1 has page in R state\n",
    "        * Other processes also have page in R state\n",
    "        * Some other process is owner\n",
    "        * Read from cache\n",
    "* You need to talk to people (processes) if\n",
    "    * P1 wants to R; no copy; other process has R copy\n",
    "        * P1 asks for a copy of the page (multicast)\n",
    "        * Owner returns copy of page\n",
    "        * P1 marks page as in R state\n",
    "    * P1 wants to R; no copy; other process has W copy\n",
    "        * P1 locates owner's copy via multicast\n",
    "        * Owner degrades copy from W to R; sends to P1\n",
    "        * P1 marks page as R\n",
    "#### Writing\n",
    "* You *don't* have to talk to people if\n",
    "    * P1 is owner of W copy\n",
    "        * Write to cache\n",
    "* You *do* have to talk to people if\n",
    "    * P1 is owner of R copy; other processes have R copy\n",
    "        * P1 asks other processes to invalidate their copy\n",
    "        * Mark page as W\n",
    "        * Write to page\n",
    "    * P1 P1 has R copy; other process is owner\n",
    "        * P1 requests other processes to invalidate their copies\n",
    "        * P1 receives ownership copy of page\n",
    "        * P1 marks page as W\n",
    "        * Writes\n",
    "    * P1 has no copy\n",
    "        * Request other proceses to invalidate their copies\n",
    "        * Receive ownership copy of page\n",
    "        * mark page as W\n",
    "        * writes\n",
    "### Downsides\n",
    "* Flip-flopping invalidations between processes\n",
    "* Lots of network transfers of files\n",
    "* Can happen when unrelated variables fall on same page\n",
    "    * False sharing - different processes have variables on the same page, causing much flip-flopping\n",
    "* __locality of interest__ section of page a process cares about\n",
    "\n",
    "## Update Approach\n",
    "* Multiple processes can have W state pages\n",
    "* On a write to a page, multicast newly written value (or part of page) to all other holders\n",
    "* Preferrable to Invalidate when:\n",
    "    * Heavy sharing between processes\n",
    "    * Writes are small\n",
    "    * Page sizes are large\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Invalidate is usually better in the real-world\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Consistency\n",
    "* Whenver multiple processes are sharing data, you have a question of consistency across all system"
